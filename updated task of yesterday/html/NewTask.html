            <p id="about-plan-one-desc">There is a direct correlation between poor personal hygine and illness. For
                this reason it is critical that textile
                workers and other personnel understand and practice good basic hygine
                habbits including a proper handwashing
                on a regular basis. The FDA white paper (FDA 1999) cited poor
                personnel hygine and improper handwashing as
                the third most important cause of illness this report
                also cited that 93% outbreaks related to textile handlers
                involved sick workers. Problems is associated
                with these outbreaks included poor personnel hygine,poor
                handwashing, open sores, improper
                gloves use, and eating while on the job.

                Textile workers are exposed to airborne particulate from natural and synthetic fibrous materials in
                their work
                environment. Exposure to cotton dust in the textile industry has been associated with several
                work-specific and
                non-specific respiratory symptoms. Cotton dust is often contaminated with Gram-negative bacteria,
                which
                contain endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide) in their outer cell wall. Some studies suggested that
                endotoxin is
                probably a major causative agent in the adverse pulmonary effects associated with organic dust
                exposure.
                Endotoxin occurs abundantly in organic dust contaminated with animal faeces and plant materials.
                Endotoxin is
                released into the air during cotton processing. Exposure to cotton dust and endotoxin has been
                implicated in the
                aetiology of a number of diseases, including byssinosis, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive
                pulmonary
                disease along with nasal and ocular irritation.
